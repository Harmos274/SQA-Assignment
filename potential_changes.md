# Potential Changes

## Introduction
This file aim to list all the things we would do differently if we would have been doing this project again.

## The list

- Start the project earlier : we started to look for article very early, but then procrastination came and we had trouble to handle the project while Maximilien was facing covid with "interesting" symptoms.
  
- The use of labels on pull request to make them more clear.

- Integrate an auto spellchecker with github CI
