## Introduction

## How to estimate tasks ?

To estimate task according to SCRUM framework, you should focus on the **amount of effort** that will be required to achiev the task. Furthermore, as it is universally accepted that the more complex a task is, the hardest it become to estimate it.  
Though we will always **estimate** the **size** of a task, by opposition to its expected **duration**.  

While there are many methods to achieve this purpose, we use **Fibonacci scale** using the **First Story as benchmark.**   

If you are interested in understanding deeply the pros and the cons of this method, as well as some few other methods, we invite you to take a close look to [this article](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/best-way-to-estimate-effort-using-story-point-in-sprint-planning-f43ad2d6fa91) since we will only cover outlines just below.

Fibonacci scale is based on **Fibonacci sequence**. It consists of numbers that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The beginning of the sequence start as below :

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

...and goes to the infinite.

In Fibonacci scale, each member estimate the complexity of the task only numbers from fibonacci sequence and present it to the rest of the group. It will leads to a **discussion** until all the team come to a consensus.

And that's it ! Pretty simple, isn't it ?

However we expect **every team members** to pay attention **carrefuly** the two rules elements below.

### The importance of discussion  

Task estimation is achieved with the **whole team**. As mentionned on the aboved mentionned article:
> _"it is not surprising to see different even contradictory views on how effort should be estimated"_

Thus you should always remember that the research of a consensus through **discussion is an integral part of the job, if not the essence of it**.

_N.B. : The voice of a newcomer worth as much as the other voice. Hence a proper enboarding is very important_  
  
### Forget the _duration_ and focus on  the _size_ of a task
By estimating a task in SCRUM, we try to capture its complexity through the amount of effort we expect that will be needed.  
Thus, despite it can be a great temptation to make a parallel with the amount of time you expect to work on a task. By estimating, you also want to **estimate the risk** the task consume a lot of time.
This subject has been discussed many time on the internet, so that I invite you to browse by yourself on the internet. Stackoverflow threads such as [this one](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/216796/how-to-estimate-tasks-in-scrum) will help you to understand the purpose of this statement more accurately.
