# Project Plan

## Introduction

Before i write down the project plan, i'd like to precise that we organise ourselves through [our GitHub issue workflow](https://github.com/Harmos274/SQA-Assignment/issues/1) were every sub issues have their own topic and plan. 

**It also explains why this file was not added to the repository in first as requested in the subject.**

In our workflow, every pair works on a different section (for example, Maximilien and Matthis work on Task Estimation in SCRUM), merging sub branches in those section only needs the approval of the other member of the pair. However, merging a branch in **develop** needs the approval of **everybody**, as well as merging **develop** in **main**.
