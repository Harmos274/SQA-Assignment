## Introduction

## Task Estimation in Scrum

### Introduction

### How to estimate tasks ?

To estimate task according to SCRUM framework, you should focus on the **amount of effort** that will be required to achiev the task. Furthermore, as it is universally accepted that the more complex a task is, the hardest it become to estimate it.  
Though we will always **estimate** the **size** of a task, by opposition to its expected **duration**.  

While there are many methods to achieve this purpose, we use **Fibonacci scale** using the **First Story as benchmark.**   

If you are interested in understanding deeply the pros and the cons of this method, as well as some few other methods, we invite you to take a close look to [this article](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/best-way-to-estimate-effort-using-story-point-in-sprint-planning-f43ad2d6fa91) since we will only cover outlines here.  

Then below, you will find the two main rules that you should never forget while estimating tasks

#### The importance of discussion  

Task estimation is achieved with the **whole team**. As mentionned on the aboved mentionned article:
> _"it is not surprising to see different even contradictory views on how effort should be estimated"_  
> 
Thus you should always remember that the research of a consensus through **discussion is an integral part of the job, if not the essence of it**.

_N.B. : The voice of a newcomer worth as much as the other voice. Hence a proper enboarding is very important_  
  
#### Forget the _duration_ and focus on  the _size_ of a task
By estimating a task in SCRUM, we try to capture its complexity through the amount of effort we expect that will be needed.  
Thus, despite it can be a great temptation to make a parallel with the amount of time you expect to work on a task. By estimating, you also want to **estimate the risk** the task consume a lot of time.
This subject has been discussed many time on the internet, so that I invite you to browse by yourself on the internet. Stackoverflow threads such as [this one](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/216796/how-to-estimate-tasks-in-scrum) will help you to understand the purpose of this statement more accurately.
