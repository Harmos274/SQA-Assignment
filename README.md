## Introduction

## Task Estimation in Scrum

### Introduction

The task estimation is a very important part of the SCRUM process for different reasons:

> Estimates allow us to predict when a Sprint Goal will be met, and therefore when a substantial increment of value will be delivered

>Our estimates help our stakeholders plan ahead. They are part of the value we provide

>Estimates help us to de-risk scope of uncertain size and complexity

>Estimated work can be traded in and out of scope for other work of similar size. Without estimates you can't trade

>The very process of estimation adds value. When we estimate we discuss requirements in more detail, and gain a better understanding of what is needed

You can find a complete discussion of the **pros and cons** we should estimate tasks in SCRUM [here](https://dzone.com/articles/agile-estimation-practice). Notice that in this article are presented several methods of estimation, but in the section below, you will be explained the **fibonacci** method of task estimation.
