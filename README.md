## Introduction

## Task Estimation in Scrum

## Coding Standards

### General Knowledge

#### Solid Principles

#### Testing practices

Unit tests allow the developer to be sure that an extract of code works. It consists of small tests making sure small parts of code operate well.

>Unit tests help you find and fix bugs earlier.

>Your suite of unit tests becomes a safety net for developers.

>Unit tests can contribute to higher code quality.

>Unit tests might contribute to better application architecture.

>Unit tests can act as documentation.

>Detect code smells in your codebase.

Unit Tests Role In A QA Strategy, and it is one of the best ways to get constant feedback on your code. It is additional with other types of code, being part of the practical test pyramid, but is the testing section performed by developers.

Tests should be fast, simple and redable, but should not repete logical implementation of code.
