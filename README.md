## Introduction

## Task Estimation in Scrum

### Introduction

The task estimation is a very important part of the SCRUM process for different reasons:

> Estimates allow us to predict when a Sprint Goal will be met, and therefore when a substantial increment of value will be delivered

>Our estimates help our stakeholders plan ahead. They are part of the value we provide

>Estimates help us to de-risk scope of uncertain size and complexity

>Estimated work can be traded in and out of scope for other work of similar size. Without estimates you can't trade

>The very process of estimation adds value. When we estimate we discuss requirements in more detail, and gain a better understanding of what is needed

You can find a complete discussion of the **pros and cons** we should estimate tasks in SCRUM [here](https://dzone.com/articles/agile-estimation-practice). Notice that in this article are presented several methods of estimation, but in the section below, you will be explained the **fibonacci** method of task estimation.

### How to Estimate Tasks

### Most Common Errors

Here you can find two articles treating the easy mistakes you can make while estimating tasks in SCRUM: [12 Common Errors Made When Using Story Points]() and [Do & Don’t - Sprint Backlog Estimation](). Those posts are really interesting and explain the major issues in using story points, during the estimation but also during the rest of the sprint.

However, some mistakes seem **occur frequently**:

#### Don’t Compare Story Points With Hours

The effort estimation is **relative** between each developer, story points allow developers who work at different speeds to **estimate effort together**. By translating it into hours, you lose the main reason to use story points.

#### Averaging Story Points

During the estimation process, if half of the team says 2, and the second half says 5, it is a **mistake** to average story point at 3. Task estimation trend to **lower the risk** of unknown size or complexity of product backlog items. If a huge difference in estimation happens, it frequently attests of **hidden complexity** or **misunderstanding** of the task. You also will lose an opportunity for an interesting discussion.

To avoid the averaging of story points, it is recommended to **discuss and estimate again** to use the process explained by the image above.

#### Conforming to the Expert in the Room

While estimating the tasks, it is highly likely that every member of the team would **conform with the expert** of the group. To avoid it, it is recommended to let the expert **explain his view of the task**, and then proceed to the estimation **without the expert**.

As story points do not take part in the **SCRUM guide**, a lot of teams have different opinions about them. Knowing things not to do will help you to exploit **the power of story points**.
